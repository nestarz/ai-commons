  ## Form A : Specific Terms related to the type of Licensed Common

  This form A allows the Contributor, given the specific nature of the Licensed Common, to define specific terms applicable. When filling this Form, the Contributor checks the box(es) corresponding to the type(s) of Common(s) that he intends to make benefit from the terms of this License. 

  **The Contributor declares that the following stipulations are applicable to the Licensed Common:**
options:
  - id: algorithms
    type: checkbox
    title: Algorithms
    description: A machine-learning algorithm is a mathematical model that learns to find patterns in the input that is fed to it. This input is referred to as training data.
    license: |-
      ### Algorithms

      The Common includes one or more Algorithm(s)
    code: >-
      def train(x, y):
        weights = 2 * random((3, 1)) - 1
        for iteration in range(epoch):
            output = 1 / (1 + exp(-dot(x, weights)))
            weights += dot(x.T, (y - output) * output * (1 - output))

  - id: models
    type: checkbox
    title: Models
    description: Weights and biases are the learnable parameters of your model. When presented with data during training, they are adjusted towards values that have correct output.
    license: |-
      ### Models
      The Common includes one or more Model(s). 

      If the model is supported by training dataset, the level of confidence is in this model is strong for the User. Conversely, if the model is not supported by training dataset, the User is warned against the low level of confidence of the model.
    code: |-
      weights = train(x, y)
      >>> [0.12,0.1981,0.679,0.235]

  - id: database
    type: checkbox
    title: Databases
    license: |-
      ### Databases

      The Common includes one or more database(s)

      _Provided the Contributor has checked this box, the following terms are part of the License. The User agrees to:_

      **IP protection of databases.** A database is "a collection of works, data or other independent elements, arranged in a systematic or methodical manner, and individually accessible by electronic means or by any other means." The structure of a database, which is the way the data are organized, is protected by copyright. 

      **_Sui generis_ right.** In addition to the IP rights that protects the structure of the database, its content is protected _sui generis_ under applicable copyright laws. The _sui generis_ right of databases has the meaning given to it in the User License. For the sake of clarity, the Contributor grants the User the right to extract, reuse, reproduce and share the content of the database in its entirety (except for the sharing of Derivative Works if the Contributor has selected the "Derived Works Prohibition" Attribution) or part (and including "a quantitatively or qualitatively significant part") of the contents of the database. If the User uses a quantitatively or qualitatively significant part of the database by including it in a new database of which he is a producer, this second database shall be considered as a Derivative Work.
    code: >-
      X = [[0, 0, 1], 
          [1, 1, 1], 
          [1, 0, 1],
          ...
          [0, 1, 1]]
      Y = [[0, 1, 1, ..., 0]].T

      ### Training dataset

      The Common includes one or more Training dataset

      _Provided the Contributor has checked this box, the following terms are part of the License. The User agrees to:_
